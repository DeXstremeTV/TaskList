Task Tracker Application:
Using Angular for FE, and picocss for styling.
Create a basic task tracker application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The application can have the following features:

Task List: Display a list of tasks with details such as task name, description, due date, and status.

Add Task: Allow users to add new tasks with relevant details.

Edit Task: Enable users to edit existing tasks, modifying details like the task name, description, due date, and status.

Delete Task: Provide an option to delete tasks from the list.

Task Status: Implement different statuses for tasks, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."

Save to File: Allow users to save the task list to a file and load it later.

This project will involve working with basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, user input validation, and file I/O. You can use a simple console application or create a desktop application with a graphical user interface using a framework like Windows Forms or WPF.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
